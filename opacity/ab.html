		<h1>DAFFODILS</h1>
		<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
The speaker says that, wandering like a cloud floating above <br>
hills and valleys, he encountered a field of daffodils beside a<br> 
lake. The dancing, fluttering flowers stretched endlessly along<br>
the shore, and though the waves of the lake danced beside the <br>
flowers, the daffodils outdid the water in glee. The speaker <br>
says that a poet could not help but be happy in such a <br>
joyful company of flowers. He says that he stared and stared,<br>
but did not realize what wealth the scene would bring him. For <br>
now, whenever he feels “vacant” or “pensive,” the memory flashes <br>
upon “that inward eye / That is the bliss of solitude,” and <br>
his heart fills with pleasure, “and dances with the daffodils.”<br>
<br>

<h2><b>Form</b></h2>

<h2><b>Commentary</b></h2>

This simple poem, one of the loveliest and most famous in the <br>
Wordsworth canon, revisits the familiar subjects of nature and <br>
memory, this time with a particularly (simple) spare, musical eloquence.<br>
The plot is extremely simple, depicting the poet’s wandering<br>
and his discovery of a field of daffodils by a lake, the memory<br>
of which pleases him and comforts him when he is lonely, bored, or restless.<br>
The characterization of the sudden occurrence <br>
of a memory—the daffodils “flash upon the inward eye /<br> 
Which is the bliss of solitude”—is psychologically acute, <br>
but the poem’s main brilliance lies in the reverse personification of <br>
its early stanzas. The speaker is metaphorically compared <br>
to a natural object, a cloud—“I wandered lonely as a cloud / <br>
That floats on high...”, and the daffodils are continually <br>
personified as human beings, dancing and “tossing their heads”<br>
 in “a crowd, a host.” This technique implies an <br>
inherent unity between man and nature, making it one of Wordsworth’s<br>
 most basic and effective methods for instilling in the <br>
reader the feeling the poet so often describes himself as experiencing<br>
